Generated Network Isolation Templates
-------------------------------------
These templates were generated by the UI tool at
https://github.com/cybertron/tripleo-scripts#net-iso-genpy

ui-settings.pickle is specific to the tool.  TripleO will not use it when
doing deployments with these templates, but it is needed to be able to
load the templates into the UI again.  Note that the UI only reads this file,
so any changes made by hand to the templates will not be reflected in the UI.

The network-isolation.yaml file needs to reference the port files shipped with
tripleo-heat-templates, so by default the tool generates the paths assuming
network-isolation.yaml will be copied into the environments/ directory of
tripleo-heat-templates.

If the standard tripleo-heat-templates are in use, then the
network-isolation-absolute.yaml file can be used instead.  It has hard-coded
references to the port files in /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates.

If the generated network isolation templates are at ~/generated-templates, an
example deployment command would look like:

openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e ~/generated-templates/network-isolation-absolute.yaml -e ~/generated-templates/network-environment.yaml
