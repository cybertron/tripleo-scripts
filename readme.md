### Convenience scripts for tripleo ###

This is just a collection of scripts I've put together that I use for tripleo development.

The do-*-configuration scripts are basically a scripted version of some of the steps in devtest for when I'm running through the instructions manually.  They may very well be out of date, so run them with care.

devtest.rc and run-devtest are more for full devtest.sh runs.  devtest.rc is the default environment that I use for devtest, with a few options included for convenience when I need to do something non-default.
