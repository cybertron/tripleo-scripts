### Convenience scripts for tripleo ###

This is just a collection of scripts I've put together that I use for tripleo development.

devtest.rc and run-devtest are more for full devtest.sh runs.  devtest.rc is the default environment that I use for devtest, with a few options included for convenience when I need to do something non-default.

QuintupleO-related pieces (including openstackbmc) have moved to https://github.com/cybertron/openstack-virtual-baremetal  The files remaining here should be considered deprecated, and will be removed at some point in the future.
